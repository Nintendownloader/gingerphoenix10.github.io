<p>So, if you are here, you either looked at the websites code or I told you about this. This website shows all the steps to viewing any wifi network's password without enabling developer mode (which we cant). Step 1: Check the name of the network. If  you can't find it, go to settings, network and check the currently connected wifi's name. Now encode that wifi name into hex by putting that wifi name into the box at <a href="https://www.convertstring.com/EncodeDecode/HexEncode">https://www.convertstring.com/EncodeDecode/HexEncode</a>. Once decoded, go to the url <a href="chrome://sync-internals/">chrome://sync-internals/</a>, then click search at the top, and put in the encoded text that the first website gave you (should be random letters and number). Once you do that, click search and 1 thing should show on the left. Click that, and find the "passphrase" box under "SPECIFICS" and "wifi_configuration". Copy the text inside the quotes, and paste them into <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/">https://www.base64decode.org/</a> and click decode. The output that is gives you should be the wifi password to the network you are currently connected to. Congrats</p>
